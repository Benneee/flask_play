# Flask Play
A not-so-quick-overview of what I can do with the Python microframework, Flask, If I intend to build a web app

## Libraries Used
- Flask-Bcrypt for password management
- Flask-Login for authentication and session management
- Flask-Mail for email 
- Flask-WTF for Forms
- ItsDangerous for tokens
- Pillow for images
- Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM

## BackStory
This is a first foot-dipping into Flask. 

So far, the resources I have gotten for this learning journey look to be great.
I don't want to jinx the journey by saying I will be creating more stuff with Flask in the nearest future,
but honestly, I want to build more apps sooner than later.

The target is APIs and other stuff I can do on the back-end other than web applications

Let's Go!!

Any other YouTube Resource I Find

As I favor books and reading resources over videos when I have the time, and this time, I think I do, I will be using more of that than videos.
