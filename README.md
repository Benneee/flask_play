# Flask Play
Simple blog to learn the basics of the Python microframework, Flask.
A 15-videos-playlist-not-so-quick-overview of what I can do with Flask If I intend to build a web app
and do with the amazing microframework

## BackStory
This is a first foot-dipping into Flask. 

Done Django bits in the past, but it looks to me like a better step to move from Flask to Django,
So far, the resources I have gotten for this learning journey look to be amazing.
I don't want to jinx the journey by saying I will be creating more stuff with Flask in the nearest future,
but honestly, I really want to build more apps in the nearest future.
Target is APIs and other stuff I can do on the back-end other than web applications

Let's Go!!

As I favour books and reading resources over videos when I have the time, and this time, I think I do, I will be using more of that than videos. I just couldn't resist this playlist.
